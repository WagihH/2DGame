We decided that making a simple video game would be the perfect chance to use object-oriented programming while working on a topic we both
find engaging. Our idea for the game changed many times as we assessed what game would be both fun and interesting, while also being
achievable within our limited scope. 

We ended up finding a YouTube tutorial that helped us form the basis of our code such as the game clock, the framework that allows our game to
render objects and levels smoothly while tracking the Frames-Per-Second. The video also taught us an efficient and organized way to separate 
our code into classes and how to generate a simple window to draw our objects on.

The tutorial can be found here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gir2R7G9ws&list=PLWms45O3n--6TvZmtFHaCWRZwEqnz2MHa
(We only used the first few videos, not the whole series)

Once we had all the necessary foundations laid, our project branched off from the video's, where we used our own creative vision to finalize 
the game. In our game, you, the player, are a green block who you can move using standard WASD controls. Your goal is to reach the yellow 
key in the center of the map, then reach the blue door to proceed to the next level. There are red enemies that deal damage to you if they 
touch you, and there are walls that obstruct your path. If you die, the level restarts, and each level grows increasingly difficult 
(if you want to see each level but cannot beat one, the right arrow key will skip to the next level).

To run the game, download the included .java files and run Game.java which holds the main method. The game requires a computer screen of at
least 720x540 pixels, and it is unlikely that there will be any problems with the frame rate.
